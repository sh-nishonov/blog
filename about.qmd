My name is Shohjahon. I got my BS degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 2020 from Inha University in Tashkent. This blog is my way to learn new things and teach others what I have learnt. By writing about machine learning and deep learning, I am also willing to deepen my knowledge on it. This blog is all about practical side of machine learning. I will share end-to-end pipeline of making ML models. I may write about theoretical part in future.


Mainly, I will share my knowledge on building models, deploying models and some useful stuff about Kaggle competitions in which I participate or find interesting. Each material will be clearly explained, for sure. My primary interest is Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. Most posts will be on these topics, but I will write about other areas of Machine Learning too.
